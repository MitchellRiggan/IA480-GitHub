    "- **Connecting to a MongoDB database** to store and retrieve tweets.\n",
    "- **Extracting tweets** and converting them into a structured format for further analysis.\n",
    "- **Creating a vector store** and uploading tweets for semantic search.\n",
    "- **Using file search** to analyze private datasets.\n",
    "- **Performing web search** to retrieve the latest public information.\n",
    "- **Utilizing stateful responses** to maintain conversation context.\n",
    "- **Combining file and web search** to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) applications.\n",
