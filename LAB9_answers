1. **Model Reasoning**
   - The model's reasoning is very good. It came to nearly the same conclusions I did when I analyzed the data and was able to acquire such answers much faster.

2. **Application to Real-Life Intelligence Workflows**
   - This approach could most certainly be applied to real-life intelligence workflows.
   - My only concern is the risk of posting classified data and giving it to AI for analysis.

3. **Limitations on Open-Source Data Access**
   - The AI should likely be limited in what data it can obtain through open-source browsing.
   - Just like the USIC (United States Intelligence Community), the AI should have restrictions to:
     - Protect people's privacy.
     - Limit its knowledge on things it shouldn't have access to.
